ThreeSumClosest - Python Solution
ThreeSumClosest is a Python module that efficiently finds three integers in an array such that their sum is closest to a given target number. This implementation utilizes the two-pointer technique after sorting the array to ensure optimal performance.

Features
Efficient Searching: Leverages sorted array properties with two pointers to minimize the difference between the current sum and the target.
Optimal Solution: Quickly converges to the closest possible sum, even returning the exact target sum immediately when found.
Easy Integration: Simple function call that takes an array of integers and a target sum as input.
How It Works
The function first sorts the input array to enable the two-pointer technique, which efficiently finds the best possible sum close to the target by adjusting two pointers based on whether the current sum is below or above the target.

Use Case
Ideal for problems in computational geometry, finance, and gaming where finding a sum close to a desired target from a set of numbers is required.

Example
python
Copy
# Instantiate the solution class
solution = Solution()

# Example array and target
nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4]
target = 1

# Get the closest sum
closest_sum = solution.threeSumClosest(nums, target)
print("The closest sum is:", closest_sum)
